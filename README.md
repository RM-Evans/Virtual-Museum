# Virtual-Museum

Using API's to explore Museums

##Proposal
***
Web app that uses Museum API's and Wikipedia API that allows the user to browse through a museum's archives and provide information from wikipedia along with the museum's content. 

This project is meant to providing an immersive travel experience to those who cannot travel, but would like to, during the Covid-19 Pandemic.
