## General Info
***
Using API's to return images from The Smithsonian Institutes archives along with links to Wikipedia articles.
Entering and submitting a search query will take you to a results page, displaying the content.
An "About Us" page and "Our goal" page will also be present, where on which the former will tell the user about the creators and where they can find the team member's github pages, and the latter displaying our reasons and goals
for this project.

## Proposal
***

As avid travelers and history buffs our team would like to create a web app that uses The Smithsonian's open access API and Wikipedia API in order to allow the user to browse through search for images in The Smithsonians archives and provide information from wikipedia along with the content. 

This project is meant to provide an immersive "travel" experience to those who are unable to travel, but would like to, during the Covid-19 Pandemic. We would like to provide an educational resource that makes it easy to find photos along with the information regarding the photo's subject.
